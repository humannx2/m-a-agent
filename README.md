# M&A Analysis Multi-Agent System

## Project Overview

This project implements a multi-agent AI system using the `crewai` framework to perform detailed analysis on a company for potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The system takes a company's name and website URL as input, and generates a comprehensive investment memo.

The multi-agent crew consists of three specialized agents working together under the supervision of a manager LLM in a hierarchical process:

1.  **Company Website Analyst**: This agent is responsible for scraping the target company's website to extract key information such as its value proposition, target audience, products, and services.
2.  **Market News Researcher**: This agent scours the web for recent news, press mentions, and other public signals related to the company. It also identifies the company's main competitors.
3.  **Lead Investment Analyst**: This agent synthesizes the information gathered by the other two agents into a structured investment memo, providing a final recommendation and a confidence score.

## Architecture Diagram

The workflow is managed hierarchically, allowing a manager LLM to orchestrate the agents and the flow of information to produce the final investment memo.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd m-a-agent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up API Keys:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `m-a-agent` directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    SERPER_API_KEY="..."
    ```
    You need an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and [Serper](https://serper.dev) for the web search capabilities.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    The application will prompt you to enter the company name and website URL in the console.

## Design Choices & Trade-offs

*   **Process Model**: I chose a `hierarchical` process over a `sequential` one. This allows a `manager_llm` (`gpt-4o`) to intelligently delegate tasks and manage the flow of information between agents. This is more robust than a simple sequential pipeline, as the manager can ensure the final analyst gets all the necessary context from both the website scraping and market research before starting its work.

*   **Agent Specialization**: The agents have distinct roles and tools (`ScrapeWebsiteTool` for the website analyst, `SerperDevTool` for the market researcher). This separation of concerns makes the system more modular and easier to debug or extend. The `LeadInvestmentAnalyst` has no tools and focuses solely on synthesizing the provided data, preventing it from fetching new, potentially conflicting information.

*   **LLM Selection**: The project uses `gpt-4` for the analysis agents (`CompanyWebsiteAnalyst` and `MarketNewsResearcher`) to leverage its strong reasoning capabilities for extracting and summarizing information. For the final synthesis task, `o3-mini` is used for the `LeadInvestmentAnalyst`. This could be a cost-saving measure, as the final memo generation is more of a structured formatting task based on provided context, which a smaller model can handle effectively.

*   **Limitations & Improvements**:
    *   The `ScrapeWebsiteTool` is effective for static websites but may fail to extract information from heavily JavaScript-rendered or single-page applications (SPAs). To improve this, the system could be upgraded to use more advanced scraping tools like Selenium or Playwright, which can render JavaScript.
    *   The market analysis is limited to what the `SerperDevTool` can find. It doesn't include analysis of financial statements (e.g., from SEC filings), which is a critical part of M&A analysis. A future improvement would be to add a new agent specialized in financial analysis, equipped with tools to access and parse financial documents.
    *   The analysis is currently limited to English-language sources.

## Example Prompts

Here are the prompts that define the behavior of each agent and task in the system.

### Agent Prompts
